<i>So what's the point of this?</i><br>
Basically, you're trying to figure out which 5 person roster is the most likely to win against any other 5 person roster.<br><br>

<i>I'm overwhelmed! Where do I start?</i><br>
Just try changing some characters around and see what happens. Focus on the first three stages to begin with (each stage starts with a location heading.)<br><br>

<i>I'm still overwhelmed! I feel like I won't ever figure this out</i><br>
That's okay! You don't really need to fully solve the simulation, you just need your best guess to be better than everyone else who submits for the tournament. Trying to fully solve the simulation will be pretty hard, so seeing how well you do relative to other people in the tournament is the main idea.<br><br>

<i>Why does the simulator allow duplicate characters across teams but not on the same team?</i><br>
Good question! When you submit your 5 person roster for the eventual tournament, someone you're competing against may have submitted some of the same characters. It's beneficial to understand what happens when both teams try to utilize the same character.<br><br>

<i>Can I save/load results?</i><br>
Not yet, hopefully next time. Taking paper notes is allowed :)<br><br>

<i>What will the tournament format be?</i><br>
Randomly seeded double elim bracket<br><br>

<i>What happens in the tournament if I am matched against the exact same 5 person roster that I selected?</i>
Technically only one advances, but basically those players would share whatever place that roster eventually wound up in. I don't think this will be very likely, but if it does happen I will know to make the simulation more complex next time!<br><br>

<i>What if I find a bug in the simulation?</i><br>
<a href="https://forms.gle/2FUBfhy3unURsdRH8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can submit it here!</a> There is a separate contest for who can find the most bugs. Typos in the output text do not count as bugs for the purposes of the contest but you should still let me know :P<br><br>
